```javascript
const query = { name: 'John Doe' };
const update = { $set: { age: 30 } };

db.collection('users').updateOne(query, update, { upsert: true });
```
This code intends to update a user's age. If the user doesn't exist, it should create one (due to `upsert: true`). However, a problem arises if the `name` field in the `users` collection isn't indexed.  MongoDB's upsert operation will perform a collection scan for every upsert, impacting performance significantly for large collections. 

The slow operation is not immediately apparent, and the error messages might be vague. Debuggers might not pinpoint the inefficiency directly, making it a tricky bug to identify.
